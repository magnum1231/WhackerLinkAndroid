# WhackerLinkAndroid
Android app to connect with WhackerLinkServer

This a a modification of WhackerLinkFiveM that has been made to run on an android device and integrates compatability with the device's hardware buttons.

Currently, there are a few things that are either bugged or just poorly implenented by me:
- it will work on the default codeplug and if you want to use your own, it will need to be recompiled and have the contents of codeplug.basic.yml replaced.
    I am working on adding file selector to make it easier. (you will be able to see it in the settings but it probably won't work)
- The UI is designed to run on some of those cheap touchscreen Zello 'radios' so it may appear small on your device.
    Again, this will be fixed later on, from my testing it should be useable on most devices right now. (but not pretty)
- Probably a good bit of bloat can be removed, as this still contains excess code from the original fivem version (This will be cleared out as I go through to do other fixes/improvements)
